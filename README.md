# Parallax Background 
Parallax Background Template 
developed in Godot Engine 4.2.

## What is a Parallax Effect?
A parallax effect is the effect, when different "2D" elements in a scene move at different speeds, which creates a 3D depth effect.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Godot Engine v4.2.1.
3. Navigate to the main scene and run the game.
